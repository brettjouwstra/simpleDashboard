# Simple Dashboard

Simple Dashboard is meant to be just that... simple! Easy to change, extend, use, etc. 

The sidebar is built using [PureCSS](https://purecss.io) and the graphs are a product of [Charts.js](https://www.chartjs.org) otherwise everything else is straightforward custom css. 

### Changes/Updates

To make adjustments simplely edit the CSS files named according to the elements they style. 

1. leftnav.css - styles the navigation bar

2. main.css - styles the main content area

3. modal.css - styles the modal and the componets that interact with it (i.e. the buttons to open it, etc.)
